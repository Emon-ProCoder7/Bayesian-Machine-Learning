# **Naive Bayes**  

## 01. Email Classifier

  In this project, I've used Naive Bayes implementation on several different datasets. By reporting the accuracy of the classifier, it can be found which datasets are harder to distinguish. 

  
### Project Goals:
  
- How difficult it is to distinguish the difference between emails about hockey and emails about baseball?
- How hard is it to tell the difference between emails about hockey and emails about tech? 
- Building an email classifier that classifies emails containing conflicting political issues (Policts_guns, Middle East, Religions)

# **Bayes Theorem**  

## 01. Does MCQ Grading Really Judge Students Knowledge?

  Grading a multiple choice exam is easy. But how much do multiple choice exams tell us about what a student really knows? Dr. Dirac is administering a statistics midterm exam and wants to use Bayes’ Theorem to help him understand the following:
  
### Project Goals:
  
- ***Given that a student answered a question correctly, what is the probability that she really knows the material?***
